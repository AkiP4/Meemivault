This project is intended to be a fairly simple database driven filesharing website.

In the beginning, we are going to make the page work by hosting it through the local network with Xampp- tool, but i've bought a hosting service kit from Hostinger so that we could host it through the domain meemivault.xyz. Following several guides and video serieses, i decided to use Handlebars for templating. I learned handlebars and some simple expressions from here: https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#what-is-handlebars
